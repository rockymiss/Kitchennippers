# Kitchen Nippers

For my **Portfolio 1 Project** on the **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)** course I have created a fictional website called Kitchen Nippers that teaches children and their adults how to cook together. 

Please click [here](https://rockymiss.github.io/kitchennippers/) for link to the website 

The Design has been focused to **Desktop** first and **Responsive**

-----
## Who is this website for and what does it do? 
-----

Kitchen Nippers is for adults and children that teaches them how to cook together using simple recipes that everyone will eat and are easy to make.  It's targeted at parents who want to spend more time with their children in the kitchen but may not have a lot of time to go through difficult recipes with them. Kitchen Nippers is entirely online with a view to expanding in the future.  For the purpose of this Portfolio website Flatbread is the recipe the website is focusing on for January 2022. 

-----
## User Experience
-----

### From a User's Perspective
As a user it is important: 

1. that it is easy to navigate the site.
2. to learn an easy recipe to make with their child.
3. that the website doesn't require a lot of time to find what they want.
4. that the instructions are clear.
5. that everything that is needed is listed.
6. to find out more about the company and other recipes they may have.

### Users Fulfilment

1. In order to guide the user to what they want the navigation, footer and content are laid out in a clear way.
2. the user can find the recipe that is suited to a level for a child or beginner adults learning how to cook.
3. The recipe can be found on all pages through navigation links or buttons.  As there is only one recipe there is no need to search.
4. Clear instructions are laid out in the recipe page together with a video for assistance.
5. Everything including the cooking implements are included in the recipe section.
6. The idea is that the user can sign up to a monthly newstletter which will give them access to past and future recipes and more tips to learn how to cook.

## UX 5 Planes 
-----

### Strategy 

The website is created to get adults and children cooking together using simple yet effective recipes.  Once a month an easy recipe is posted with clear instructions and an opportunity is there to sign-up to learn more and to get more recipes.   Only one recipe a month is posted.  It is hoped that users like the site, it's ease of use, the easy recipes posted and that they come back each month for a new recipe.

The main aim is that the adults have very little to navigate to get to the instructions and the recipe, there is less to read, and the layout is simple so there are little to no distractions. 

### Scope  

Features are set up to be simple, welcoming and easy to use.  The main existing features are: 

- Logo
    - The Logo for Kitchen Nippers is located on all pages and will link back to the home page when clicked. 
    
- Navigation
    - The navigation menu is located on all pages below the Logo.  It contains links to all of the pages on the website and they are fully responsive.   A text shadow is used so that the text will glow/shine on the page that is active to show the user which page they are currently on. 

- Footer Social Media Links 
    - The Footer is located at the bottom of every page and links to Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter.   The Instagram and Youtube links will link directly to the video on how to make Flatbread. 

- Buttons
    - There is a button to "Get Cooking on the Home Page and on the Sign-up page for ease of use.  

### Structure Plane

There are 4 different pages on this website: 

- Home page:  
  This is the first page the user will see.  It's designed to give a clear direction of what the website is about.  An overlay is placed over the main image with the words "Learn to Cook with Kitchen Nippers".  The main image was chosen as it was primarily a parent cooking happily with their child which gives a very good idea of what the site is about.  Beneath the image there is an about section telling the user a little bit about Kitchen Nippers.  A "Get Cooking" button is featured at the bottom of the page which will bring the user directly to the recipe page.      

- Recipe Page:  
  This page lets the user know about the recipe for the month which is Flatbread for January 2022.  Clear instructions are given, a list of ingredients and tools required and an instructional video on how to make Flatbread.  In my experience recipe pages are sometimes complex and full of information users do not want to know about.  The recipe page is designed to get to the point quickly as the users being targetted are parents who generally have very little time to read about the history of Flatbread or the lives of the people showing you how to cook it! 

- The Sign-up page:  
  The Sign-up page allows the user to sign-up to monthly newsletters which will give them access to past recipes and hints and tips on cooking.  It is a straightforward form asking for the users name and email address.   **It is important to note that for the purpose of this Portfolio that the sign-up page is a dummy page and the action 'GET' was used instead of 'POST'.**  

- Thank you page:  
  Once the user submits the form on the Sign-up page they will be redirected to this page thanking them.  It is beneficial for users to know if they have completed forms correctly and this will give them an indication that they have done.  

### Skeleton 

The design was focused to desktop first but can be used on smaller devices such as tablets and mobiles too.  Wireframes are done using balsamiq:

### Surface  

##### Colors 

The following palette of colors were chosen as they were clean, welcoming and easy to read: 

![alt text](put palette here)

#/rgb(22,57,80) - for navigation menu, footer menu and buttons. 
#/rgb(167,182,199.08) - for overlay circle  
#/rgb(167,182,199) - for hover over links 
#/rgb(22242,244,248) - for background to text sections 
#/rgb(255) - for website background and text on navigation, footer and buttons.  

##### Typography

For the logo the font **Anton** was used, however the logo was created externally using Canva.com.

Throughout the website the font **Poppins** was used.   This font was obtained using Google Fonts and differnt sizes were used.  These fonts fall back to sans-serif if they fail to load.  Poppins was chosen because it has a professional look and is clean and easy to read.    

For the video on YouTube the font **Bebas** was used.  This was chosen particulary because it was easy to read. 
**AmaticSC** was used on the original Instagram video in May 2020.

## Testing
-----

### Local Testing

Testing of all buttons, links, functionality and grammer on the website has been carried out.  Some links to the video needed to be updated after testing and the facebook page was not opening as local testing showed.  The link used facebook.ie instead of facebook.com so this was changed to fix the issue.  Other minor issues such as centering came up but were fixed immediately.  

### User Testing

The website was sent to a group of approximately 20 people, most of which were parents.  As a result grammatical errors came up and were fixed.  Users found the website very functional and easy to navigate.  By doing this user test I was able to check the website on the following devices: 

- Huawei P30
- IPhone 7s
- IPhone 11
- Iphone 12 Pro max
- Redmi note 9
- Samsung A21.  

This testing proved very helpful with responsivness errors.  Issues arose with iphone devices, except the pro max, where text was hidden in the about section of the index page.  This also occured on the Redmi note 9.  This issue, as shown in the images below, was fixed by adjusting the height of the sections in question.

### Browser Testing

The Website has been tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Opera.   On all browsers testing was as expected and functionality and responsiveness was good. 


### Validators 

The website was tested using Jigsaw W3C validation.  This showed up minor syntax errors and they were fixed accordingly.  Once issues were dealt with the validator showed no errors in either html or css. 

### Responsiveness 

To check responsiveness I used Google Chrome Dev Tools.  Desktop, Mobile and tablet sizes were tested.  The website responded well.   

#### Issues 

The main issue was the embedded video from Instagram.  Instagram uses alot of styles which seemed to affect my own styling.  I searched for a solution and noted that others online seemed to have the same issues with Instagram videos.  After changes to some of the styling it helped slightly but not sufficient enought for responsiveness.  As mentioned previously the video was created in May 2020.  The original video had been lost and as Instagram do not allow downloading of videos I decided to re-create the video.  As in May 2020 I used Inshot to edit the video.  Fortunately I had elements of the video so I could easily re-create the video using Inshot again.  I then posted the video to Youtube where the styling is considerably less and I could manipulate it easily to fit into my code.  Re-creating the video also meant that I could change the text on the video to be better read by the visually impaired.  I felt it was a good idea for future features to have the video on different platforms rather than in the directory.

## Version Control
-----

### Git & GitHub 

Local repository and IDE used: GitPod
Remote repository used: GitHub

Steps followed: 
- I created a new public repository on GitHub using the Code Institute template.
- I then created a workspace and started coding on GitPod. 
- Pages were created along with assets folders and css style file. 
- As I worked I previewed changes using ports to open the browser.
- To save my work safely I continued to use the terminal consistently by using: 
    - **git add .** to add work to git
    - **git commit -m""** to commit the work 
    - **git push** to update work to GitHub 

### Deployment 

I used GitHub to deploy the site by:

- Selecting the repository. 
- Click on settings. 
- Scroll down to GitHub pages and open that page. 
- Select main branch and click save.

The website is published on GitHub and the link is provided in that section.
