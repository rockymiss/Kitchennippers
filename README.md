# Kitchen Nippers

For my **Portfolio 1 Project** on the **Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications)** course I have created a fictional website called Kitchen Nippers which teaches children and their adults how to cook together. 

Please click [here](https://rockymiss.github.io/kitchennippers/) for link to the website 

The Design has been focused to **Desktop** first and **Responsive**

## Who is this website for and what does it do? 

This is a website for adults and children that teaches them how to cook together using simple recipes that everyone will eat and are easy to make.  It's targeted at parents who want to spend more time with their children in the kitchen but may not have a lot of time to go through difficult recipes with them.  Kitchen Nippers is entirely online with a view to expanding in the future.

## UX 5 Planes 

### Strategy Plane 

The website is created to get adults and children cooking together using simple yet effective recipes.  Once a month an easy recipe is posted with clear instructions and an opportunity is there to sign-up to learn more and to get more recipes.  

The main aim is that the adults have very little to navigate to get to the instructions and the recipe, there is less to read, and the layout is simple so there are little to no distractions. 

### Scope Plane 

Features include: 

- 4 different pages
- Homepage with links, buttons and logo to other pages
- Recipe/Instructions page 
- Signup Page
- Thank you page to confirm submission on form

### Structure Plane

The website consists of 3 main pages and 1 thank you page.  Each page has a specific purpose.  Pages and content are laid out so that the user can find their way around them easily. 

- Navigation and Footer 

    the navigation and footer are the same for every page.  
    
    The navigation links help the user to navigate easily when on any page.  The text will glow/shine on the page that is active to show the user which page they are currently on.  The logo at the top of each page can be used to navigate back to the homepage.   Navigation works on all screens from desktop to mobile.  

    The footer is one row which has links to four social media apps.  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.  

- Home Page

    The homepage consists of a main hero image and an overlap text telling the user in short what the website is about i.e. "Learn to Cook with Kitchen Nippers".  Beneath the image is an about section with images telling the user a little bit more about Kitchen Nippers and what the site consists of and there is a text link to the sign-up page.  There is also a 'Get Cooking' button to bring the user directly to the recipe page. 

- Recipe Page

    The recipe page is clearly laid out with information about the recipe, clear ingredients and tools needed and clear instructions.  At the bottom of the page there is a video showing the user how to make the recipe.  The video can be either viewed directly on this page or a link to YouTube and Instagram on the footer links.  

- Sign-up Page 

    The Sign-up page allows the user to sign-up to monthly newsletters which will give them access to past recipes and hints and tips on cooking.   It is important to note that for the purpose of this Portfolio that the sign-up page is a dummy page and the action 'GET' was used instead of 'POST'.  Once submitted the action will link to a thank you page.  Linking to a thank you page shows the user that filling out the form was completed.  

- Thank you Page 

    The thank you page is laid out like the other pages with the logo, navigation and footer the same.  The thank you page lets the user know the form has been completed.   The user can either click the navigation links, logo or use the button to return to the home page.  

### Skeleton Plane

The design was focused to desktop first but can be used on smaller devices such as mobiles too.  Wireframes are done using balsamiq:
