        <h2>Why Flatbread?</h2>
        <p>For most of us making bread isnt' as easy as many people make it out to be.  The truth is for the majority of people, makin gbread becomes very time consuming and in reality if you find yourself with little time left in the day it's just easier to go to the shop and buy the bread. </p>
        <p>Flatbread is a very easy alternative and also very easy for both adults and children to make!</p>
        <p>In less than 15 minutes you can put together flatbread, cook it and server it up with plenty of dishes. It goes well with soups, curries, bolognese, fry ups or simply just on it's own.  Made with just 3 main ingredients it's also a healtherier alternative to most shop-bought breads.</p>
        <p>For this recipe we are keeping it simple but if you want to make it a little bit more interesting you can add your choice of herbs and spices.  In our house we like to add some crushed fresh garlic to the butter when frying.</p>

           <h2>Instructions</h2> 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In a clean bowl mix the flour, salt and yogurt with a fork until the mixture comes together. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Roll the mixture onto a clean surface dusted with flour and then using your hands shape the mixture into a sausage shape. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cut the shape into four equal sizes. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With a rolling pin dusted with flour or the back of your hand flatten the four pieces into a disc shape.  Be careful not to use too much flour as this will burn on the pan.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a knob of butter to a hot pan and place the flatbread disc onto the pan and cook for approximately 1 minute.  While the bottom side is cooking place another knob of butter on the top side to melt, brush to spread. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Flip the flatbread and cook on the other side for another minute. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can be served immediately or eaten cold.
